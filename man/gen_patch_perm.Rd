\title{Generate an optimal permutation patch}
\usage{
gen_patch_perm(df1, df2, mismatch = diffness, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{df1}{A data frame.}

\item{df2}{A data frame.}

\item{mismatch}{Mismatch method. The default is \code{\link{diffness}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments are ignored.}
}
\value{
A \code{patch_perm} object.
}
\description{
Computes the permutation of columns, expressed as a \code{patch_perm} patch,
that minimises the mismatch between the patched \code{df1} and \code{df2},
including a permutation cost. Currently the permutation cost is ignored.
}
\details{
This function uses an assignment problem solver from the package
\code{lpSolve}.
