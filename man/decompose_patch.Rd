\description{
Patches may be composed using the \code{\link{compose}} function and the
result is a composite patch object. Given such an object, this function
returns its constituent elementary \code{patch} objects in a list in the
order in which they are applied in the composition. Compositions of
compositions are handled via tree recursion.
